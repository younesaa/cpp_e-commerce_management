Create a simple e-commerce system where users can buy and sell products. The system should have the following classes:

Product: This class should have attributes such as name, description, price, and stock quantity. It should also have methods to get and set these attributes.

User: This class should have attributes such as name, email, password, and a list of products they are selling. It should have methods to get and set these attributes and add/remove products from their list.

Cart: This class should have a list of products that the user has added to their cart. It should have methods to add and remove products from the cart and calculate the total price.

Payment: This class should have attributes such as payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.) and payment amount. It should have a method to process the payment.

Order: This class should have attributes such as order number, user, cart, payment, and order date/time. It should have a method to create a new order and update the stock quantity of each product in the cart.

The main program should allow users to:

Create an account
Log in
View a list of available products
Search for a product by name or description
Add a product to their cart
Remove a product from their cart
View their cart
Checkout and pay for their order
You can also add additional features to the system, such as:

Admin class: This class can manage the list of available products, view orders, and update order statuses.

Reviews: Users can add reviews for products, and other users can see the average rating for each product.

Wishlist: Users can add products to their wishlist for future purchases.

Discounts: The system can offer discounts based on the total order amount or specific products.
